## Perception in Gaming

- **Semantics**
  - Basic text:  simple user ideas or descriptions and basic game state variables and dialogues
  - Structured/role-based: character, story, role-related information and skills 
  - Environmental/context-specific: detailed game descriptors and contextual information and natural language instructions for tasks
  - Advanced multi-modal inputs: visual, audible, and textual data for decision-making and the combination of dialogue, game state, and scripts for richer interaction
- ~~Vision: VPT~~

---

~~## Inference in Agents~~

- **Cognitive Framework:** Adaptable to various contexts
- **Memory:** Efficient storage and retrieval for common sense
- **Learning:** Skill acquisition and strategic adaptation
- **Reasoning:** Problem-solving through information processing

---

~~## Action Execution~~

- **Interaction:** Agent's response to game state and environment
- **Behavior:** Generative coding techniques used
- **Dialogue:** Agent-agent and human-agent communications
- **Consistency:** Maintained through feedback and reinforcement

---

## Challenges in LMAs

- **Hallucinations:** Erroneous outputs from LMs
- **Error Correction:** Iterative learning and feedback mechanisms
- **Generalization:** Applying learnt knowledge to unseen tasks
- **Interpretability:** Transparent decision-making processes

---

## Future Research Directions

- ~~**Multi-Modal Perception:** Enhancing visual and auditory perceptions~~
- **Authentic Gaming:** Improving narrative generation and character simulation
- **External Tools:** Dynamic access and interpretation of online guides
- **Real-Time Gaming:** Improving efficiency and reaction times
